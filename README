CATGIRL(7)         FreeBSD Miscellaneous Information Manual         CATGIRL(7)

NAME
     catgirl â€“ IRC client

DESCRIPTION
     catgirl is a curses IRC client originally intended for use over anonymous
     SSH.

     It requires LibreSSL (-ltls) and targets FreeBSD, Darwin, NetBSD and
     GNU/Linux.

INSTALL
     On platforms other than FreeBSD, copy the appropriate file to config.mk
     and modify as needed.  The default install PREFIX is ~/.local.

           cp $(uname).mk config.mk
           make
           make install

   Darwin
     LibreSSL is assumed to be installed with brew(1).  The sandman(1) wrapper
     is also installed.

   NetBSD
     LibreSSL is assumed to be installed with pkgsrc(7).  Due to bugs in
     NetBSD's curses(3) implementation, some of the UI is currently broken.

   GNU/Linux
     LibreSSL is assumed to be manually installed in /usr/local and is
     statically linked.
