NAME
     catgirl - IRC client

DESCRIPTION
     catgirl(1) is a terminal IRC client.

     Screenshot: imagine, if you will, text on a screen, next to names in a
     selection of colours.

   Notable Features
     o	 Tab complete: most recently seen or mentioned nicks are completed
	 first.	 Commas are inserted between multiple nicks.

     o	 Prompt: the prompt clearly shows whether input will be interpreted as
	 a command or sent as a message.

     o	 Split scroll: keeps the latest messages in view while scrolling.

     o	 URL detection: recent URLs from a particular user or matching a
	 substring can be opened or copied.

     o	 Nick coloring: color generation based on usernames remains stable
	 across nick changes.  Mentions of users in messages are colored.

     o	 Topic diffing: the modified portion of a channel topic change is
	 highlighted.

     o	 Ignore: visibility of filtered messages can be toggled.

     o	 Security: on FreeBSD and OpenBSD, the restrict option enables tight
	 sandboxing.  Sandboxing is always used on OpenBSD.

   Non-features
     o	 Dynamic configuration: all configuration happens in a simple text
	 file or on the command line.

     o	 Multi-network: a terminal multiplexer such as screen(1) or tmux(1)
	 (or just your regular terminal emulator tabs) can be used to connect
	 catgirl to multiple networks.

     o	 Reconnection: when the connection to the server is lost, catgirl
	 exits.	 She can be run in a loop or connected to a bouncer, such as
	 pounce: https://git.causal.agency/pounce.

     o	 CTCP: apart from ACTION, this protocol is useless at best and enables
	 abuse at worst.

     o	 Protocol coverage: IRCv3 extensions are implemented only where they
	 contribute to the intended user experience.

     o	 Cleartext IRC: TLS is now ubiquitous and certificates are easy to
	 obtain.

INSTALLING
     catgirl requires ncurses and libtls, provided by either LibreTLS:
     https://git.causal.agency/libretls/about (for OpenSSL) or by LibreSSL.
     It targets FreeBSD, OpenBSD, macOS and Linux.  catgirl and libtls may be
     packaged for your system.	Check the Repology pages for catgirl:
     https://repology.org/project/catgirl/versions and libretls:
     https://repology.org/project/libretls/versions.

	   $ ./configure
	   $ make all
	   # make install

     Packagers are encouraged to patch in their own text macros in input.c.

     If installing libtls manually to /usr/local, for example, make sure
     /usr/local/lib appears in /etc/ld.so.conf or /etc/ld.so.conf.d/* and be
     sure to run ldconfig(8) once the library is installed.  Set
     PKG_CONFIG_PATH for ./configure to find it.

	   $ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ./configure

     The sandman wrapper is provided for macOS to stop and start catgirl on
     system sleep and wake.  To enable him, configure with:

	   $ ./configure --enable-sandman
